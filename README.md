# GBO-Knn-frameWork-for-LBVS
This is code of paper proposed a framework based on a wrapper selection approach for features selection. It consists of an optimizer, Gradient-Based Optimizer (GBO), that hybridized with the  classifier, k-nearest neighbor (k-NN). The performance of the introduced framework, GBO-KNN, is evaluated using ionosphere dataset
